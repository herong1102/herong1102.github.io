        <p>No two cats are the same, but understanding their biology and behaviour can help you to understand your pet better. Here are our top ten cat facts!<br>

            1. Cats have highly developed senses - they can detect higher frequencies of sound than dogs or humans, and have an excellent sense of smell - better than ours! They can see better than us in dark and dim light.<br>
            2. Cats are expert hunters and hunt alone. In the wild, they'll spend 6-8 hours a day hunting. They can hear the high-pitched frequencies used by small rodents and their whiskers (or 'vibrissae') are highly sensitive to vibrations, helping them to detect prey.<br>
            3. Cats are agile - they have powerful, tightly controlled muscles and fast reflexes that allow them to move quickly and gracefully. They are skilled at running, jumping, climbing and stealthily stalking prey.<br>
            4. Cats have a range of ways to communicate - including purrs, 'meows', trills, chirrups, growls, yowls, and hisses. They also communicate visually using different body postures, as well as visual markers such as scratch marks or the deposition of faeces.<br>
            5. Cats are independent - survival is a solitary affair for cats, and they're self-reliant for food, shelter, grooming and territory defence. They can be social, but prefer to choose their own companions.<br>
            6. Cats are territorial - a cat's territory is an area it defends, aggressively if required, against other cats. They use a range of methods to mark their territory, including scratching, spraying urine and depositing faeces. Help keep your cat safe outside.<br>
            7. Cats are meat eaters - meat is an important part of a cat's diet, and they can't survive without the nutrients found in animal-based food.<br>
            8. Cats love cat naps - domestic cats sleep for 12-18 hours a day! Sleep allows them to restore their energy resources, so it's vital for a predator that needs to be ready to hunt whenever it detects prey.<br>
            9. Cats are playful - they're intelligent and need both mental and physical stimulation. Play is important, as it improves motor skills, provides brain training and encourages social behaviour. Keep your cats entertained with fun toys.<br>
            10. Cats are clean animals - tiny abrasive hooks, found on the centre of cats' tongues, helps them to groom themselves. Grooming keeps a cat's coat in good condition and also helps to remove fleas and other parasites. Read more about keeping cats healthy.</p>
